# XRPLendNet
## Intro
This project was created during the London Hackathon, organised by Ripple's XRP Ledger and EasyA on 13th-14th of April 2024

#60DaysofXRPL

Decentralisation is the Future
## Relevance
Traditional way of working with loans face several sharp problems such as leak of transparency, security vulnerabilities, low effieciency and high cost of transactions since fees are included while working with traditional institutions<br>

During the hackathon we addressed these problems introducing a blockchain XRPL solution

## Project
XRPLendNet provides a platform to securely and conveniently set up, trade and achieve loans between users

Deployed on the blockchain, the application provides low cost, seamless and highly efficient functionality to operate with loans
## How to Use
To use XRPLendNet follow the [link](https://xrp-lend-net.vercel.app/)

On the home page, connect your wallet

Then you will be able to either create a new loan (as well as track your active loans) and find available loans to get 



## Technologies used

While working on the project, the following technologies were used

- XRP Ledger EVM Sidechain
- Solidity (for smart contracts)
- Next.js (for frontend)
- Tailwind (for frontend)

## Further improvements
Future development plans include:

- **Collateral System Improvement**: to automatically deliver of collateral when loan is repayed / defaulted

- **Use of Ripple's upcoming stable-coin**: to provide less risk in loans as the value will be less volatile

- **Security Enhancement**: to create a secondary securities market as opposed to directly trading loans
